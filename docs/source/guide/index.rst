The radicle guide
==================

radicle is a language for building and interacting with P2P Radicle
Machines. What these machines do--how they behave--is entirely up to you.

This guide provides an introduction to radicle--as a language, as a tool for
building chains, and as a means of interacting with existing chains.

Please see the [installation
instructions](http://radicle.xyz/docs/index.html#installation-setup) to get
started.
